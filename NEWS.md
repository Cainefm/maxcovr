# copertura 0.0.2.90000

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added a helper function to assist with extracting the results from the model
* This will eventually be broken up into smaller functions, so that you can be really specific about what function you want to run to get what result. Ideally, each function, except for the one that runs the model, should return one, or maybe two arguments.
