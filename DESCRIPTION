Description: copertura provides an easier to use interface to solve the "binary optimisation problem known as the "maximum
    location coverage problem" as described by Church, in particular the
    implementation as initially presented by Chan et al to identify ideal
    locations to place AEDs. Copertura also provides functions to make it easier
    to calculate coverage of AEDs, and other helper functions that are used in
    this area of research / applied math and statistics.
